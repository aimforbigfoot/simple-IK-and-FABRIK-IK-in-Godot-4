# Simple IK and FABRIK IK in Godot 4

![Demo](https://github.com/aimforbigfoot/simple-IK-and-FABRIK-IK-in-Godot-4/blob/main/armssss.gif)

This project shows two types of inverse kinematics (IK) for arms in Godot 4:

---

## üîπ Simple IK

- Uses **cosine law**
- Works with **2 joints max** (e.g. shoulder and elbow)
- Fast and simple

> ‚úÖ Use this if your arm only needs two joints

---

## üî∏ FABRIK IK

- Uses **FABRIK (Forward and Backward Reaching IK)**
- Supports **more than 2 joints**
- Better for flexible limbs, tails, or complex arms

> ‚úÖ Use this if you need more than two joints

---

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è in Godot 4.
